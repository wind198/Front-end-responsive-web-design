# Front end responsive web design
This is 1 of my project during "web design course".
In this project, I use HTML, CSS and Boostrap 4 to build a responsive web that could work well on all screen size.
The project inlude:
- 5HTML files which stand for 5 pages of the website
- 1 css folder which hold css files
- images folder to hold necessary picture

The website was indexed by Google and you could visit it via: https://tuanlhfx10549.000webhostapp.com/
All the web pages are also tracked by Google analytics.
